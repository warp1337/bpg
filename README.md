# Beer Pressure Gang | Strike Calculator


This "code" (since it's JS and HTML, it is not considered real code) computes 
the group size of BPG gatherings/events that is "strikeable". Nothing more than that
yet. After intense research we came up with a socially acceptable formular g = floor(2/t + 4)
where g is group size and t is the lead time in days.
